==== INTRODUCTION ====
First off, thank you for taking the time to download and consider trying VicBlog.
Although in Beta, VicBlog is fully functional and has been tested on a live webserver.
VicBlog is an Open Source blogging script written in PHP and uses a MySQL backend to store data.
VicBlog also comes with WYSIWYG editors that make your blogging experience more simple and enjoyable, while,
at the same time, providing you with an easy way to publish professionally laid out content.
VicBlog is released under version 3 of the GNU General Public License. A copy of this license is available from within
the install folder and is also visible when you start the Installation Wizard.
If you have any questions or would like to contribute to the future development of VicBlog, please go to the
Development page at Sourceforge - https://sourceforge.net/projects/vicblog/. The main website and Community Forums
will be online in the coming week or so.
You can be kept updated via your Admin CP.

==== REQUIREMENTS ====
1. Apache Server
2. PHP 5 (php 4 may work. Has not been tested)
3. MySQL

==== INSTALLATION ====
I hate it when you unzip a package and open the Installation Instructions and the first instruction goes, "Unzip the package".
It's quite obvious that if you are reading the instructions, chances are you have already carried out this step.
Anyways, here we go:

1. Unzip the package - lol Just teasing!
2. Upload the contents of the uploads folder to the server root on your hosting account. If you are using cPanel, this would be public_html
3. Setup your MySQL Database. If you don't know how to do this, contact your web hosting provider.
4. Point to install/index.php in your browser. For example, if you uploaded the script to say public_html/blog/ you will need to go to
http://yourdomain.com/blog/install/index.php
5. Follow the instructions and fill in all required data.
6. If you get a Success message, delete the install folder and go to your blog and enjoy!!!

Support, until the community forums are setup, is available from the Sourceforge development page.
